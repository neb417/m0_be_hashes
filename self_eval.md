# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
 *Some good productive struggle working through how to structure code to complete what was asking. Some unproductive struggle with the last problem on hashes_2 with = and ==.*
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
*So-so. Haven't been a good note taker in the past and I am finding a rhythm and process that is working. The guidelines provided by Turing before starting were very helpful.*
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
*Try to solve the problem first. There are issues that I face where I know that I know how to solve the issue and focus on working through it. After a solution is not found and I feel very stuck, I will Google.*
